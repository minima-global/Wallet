# MiniDapp Skeleton

- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start dev server, make sure to edit .env as displayed with .env.example
  - Setting environment variables:
  - `VITE_DEBUG=` Set this to true if you'd like to use MDS while running dev
  - `VITE_DEBUG_HOST=` Set this to your host, e.g "127.0.0.1"
  - `VITE_DEBUG_MDS_PORT=` Set this to your port, if you're running your node on port 9001, then this should be 9003
  - `VITE_DEBUG_UID=` Set this to a MiniDapp UID which you can get from the URL, 
  e.g `https://127.0.0.1:9003/SESSIONID/index.html?uid=UID`, copy the UID and set it to this variable
  - Now re-run the dev server and you should now be connected to MDS


- `npm run zip` to create your mds zip
- All set sir
